@article{thrun00robust,
	abstract = {Mobile robot localization is the problem of determining a
                  robot's pose from sensor data. This article presents a family
                  of probabilistic localization algorithms known as Monte Carlo
                  Localization (MCL). MCL algorithms represent a robot's belief
                  by a set of weighted hypotheses (samples), which approximate
                  the posterior under a common Bayesian formulation of the
                  localization problem. Building on the basic MCL algorithm,
                  this article develops a more robust algorithm called
                  Mixture-MCL, which integrates two complimentary ways of
                  generating samples in the estimation. To apply this algorithm
                  to mobile robots equipped with range finders, a kernel
                  density tree is learned that permits fast
                  sampling. Systematic empirical results illustrate the
                  robustness and computational efficiency of the approach.},

@book{thrun-proba-robotics,
	abstract = {{Probabilistic robotics is a new and growing area in
                  robotics, concerned with perception and control in the face
                  of uncertainty. Building on the field of mathematical
                  statistics, probabilistic robotics endows robots with a new
                  level of robustness in real-world situations.<br /> <br />
                  This book introduces the reader to a wealth of techniques and
                  algorithms in the field. All algorithms are based on a single
                  overarching mathematical foundation. Each chapter provides
                  example implementations in pseudo code, detailed mathematical
                  derivations, discussions from a practitioner's perspective,
                  and extensive lists of exercises and class projects. The
                  book's Web site, http://www.probabilistic-robotics.org, has
                  additional material.<br /> <br /> The book is relevant for
                  anyone involved in robotic software development and
                  scientific research. It will also be of interest to applied
                  statisticians and engineers dealing with real-world sensor
                  data.}},
